                    A Kanban tool is a software application designed to help teams implement the Kanban method for
                    project management and workflow visualization. It provides a digital platform for creating and
                    managing Kanban boards, which typically consist of columns representing different stages or statuses
                    of tasks. Team members can add tasks or cards to the board and move them across columns as work
                    progresses. Kanban tools often include features like task assignment, due dates, priority settings,
                    and collaboration options. They facilitate real-time communication, transparency, and efficiency in
                    team workflows, enabling better coordination, task tracking, and overall productivity.
